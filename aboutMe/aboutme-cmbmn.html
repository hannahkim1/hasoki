                        hannah is my first name. hannah is on all of my legal documents<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        hannah is a biblical name and originates from the hebrew name channah. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        my parents chose the name "hannah" for their first born child because "they liked it and it was a nice name", not a crazy story behind it, just that it was a pretty name

                    <p>
                        my parents decided to spell my name with a f not a ph because they took a trip to italy for their honeymoon and noticed how everyone was named sofia.<br>
                        i think they had good experiences with sofias in italy.

                    여름

                <p>
                    여름 (pronounced yeo-rum) is my Korean name. 여름 means summer in Korean.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    my birth certificate technically says my name is "hannah sofia kim", without the 여름. that is because my parents did not give me this name when I was born.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was given this name by myself, my parents, and my friends. I grew up speaking only English, so I unfortunately, I wasn't involved with Korean culture and language in my early years.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It wasn't until I was 14 that I became more in touch with my ethnic background. I gave myself the name 여름 because I truly thrive in the summer months. My friends suggested this name for me, and my parents approved.
